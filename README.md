##### Train track
A 'Train track' is a track between stations. 
The seeder defines a start and end station and adds some 'sub' stations in between to create a longer track.
When a starting station has a different country then the end station, the sub stations are divided in halves.
The first half is in the starting (station) country and other half in the end (station) country.
<br><small><i>Note: the seeder does not take into account trajectories that pass through multiple countries. E.g. a trip from the Netherlands to Poland will not have stations in Germany.</i></small>

##### Train track station
A 'Train track station' is a station located in a 'Train track'. Most Train tracks have multiple stations. The Stations are ordered by the 'order' key.
